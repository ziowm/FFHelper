Project Explanation:
This project predicts NFL team records using data from Fantasy Football. The project first reads three CSV files in order to pull
the offensive stats, defensive stats, and league schedule. Then the program creates a Team object, to represent a team in the league,
then calculates individual attributes with original formulas using the data from the CSV files. The program allows the user to choose
between three choices, a full season simulation, expected wins/losses, and individual team stats.

How to run the code:
1. Make sure the 3 CSV files and Python Script are in the same directory
2. Run from the terminal: python FFHelper.py

How to use/interpret the program:
